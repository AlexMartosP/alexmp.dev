          My interest in websites and programming started when a friend and I
          started a company at the age of 15. At first, we helped businesses
          with search engine optimization as well as Google and Facebook
          advertising. Shortly after, we saw a high demand for websites. That's
          when I started learning about WordPress and WooCommerce and built my
          first website (St√§dform).

          While running the company, I learned a great deal about teamwork but
          above all, programming and websites. We continued to help businesses
          with websites and marketing until 2021, when I started freelancing as
          a web developer. Since then, I have helped several clients from
          various industries.

          In 2022, I began studying at EC-utbildning in Helsingborg to become a
          Frontend developer. Alongside my studies, I am also studying to deepen
          my knowledge further. Additionally, I am working on various projects,
          including my personal projects, with the goal of becoming a Full stack
          developer and eventually a Software Engineer.
